## My process

I started by laying out the project as if all of the active features were present, shopping cart, nav menu, item count etc. 

Then hid the elements as a default, and had javascript add a --active class to see them as expected! I kept track of what was in the shopping cart by means of a custom class

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I was really trying to start to take advantage of the Class syntax  in Javascript and what you can do with those on page load. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:







### Continued development

My continued development will start to include css and js libraries so I can remove some of the fussing over what I consider minor parts of code that I understand fairly well at this point.
